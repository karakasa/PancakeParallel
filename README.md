# PancakeParallel

A lightweight parallel-computing framework, mainly used for [Grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_3D).

The project consists of adapters (for future support on other visual programming languages), and a parallel core. Currently the algorithm is simple round-robin based on C#'s TPL.

It is a sister project of my long-established Grasshopper plugin: [Pancake](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/pancake).
